NEW features of smake-1.2.1:

-	./.clean now removes symlinks

-	x86_64-dragonfly-cc.rul & x86_64-dragonfly-gcc.rul new

-	Addex experimental rules for using "pcc" on Solaris x86

-	New autoconf test on whether Compiler supports "inline" keyword

-	New autoconf test if struct stat contains st_atime_n (nanosecs)

-	New autoconf test if struct stat contains st_flag

-	C-dependencies on AIX are now extracted using cc -M -qsyntaxonly

-	As the new Intel 64 bit strcpy() implementation does not work
	correctly with overlapping strings, smake now includes a ovstrcpy()
	function to avoid related problems.

-	Smake now supports $(EMPTY): target names.

-	A minor bug in the makefile parser was fixed. The bug caused targets
	that appeared directly after an otherwise emty line that started
	with a TAB char to be ignored.

TODO:
	Smake would need to implement an undocumented feature from 
	historical UNIX make implementations that is used by Xorg
	at one place:

	target: *.o
		do-something-with *.o

	Which expands *.o from the filesystem. Meanwhile, use 
	smake -N to compile Xorg.

After pattern expansion has been implemented, smake-1.2 final
will be released.

P.P.S.: As Xorg changed it's build system, we may delay this
feature to something past 1.2-final.
	


WARNING: Do not use 'winzip' to extract the tar file!
	Winzip cannot extract symbolic links correctly.
