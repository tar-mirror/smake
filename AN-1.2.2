NEW features of smake-1.2.2:

-	Many updated in the schily makefile system and many new
	supported architectures.
	
	This includes gnu-kfreebsd, 64 bit Mac OS X, Pyros

-	$(CC_COM) is now available for all architectures

-	The makefile system now supports cross compiling with
	automated remote execution of test binaries.

-	The makefile system now supports Android

-	See announcement files at ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/schily/
	for more informations and full details on the extensions
	in the schily makefile system.

-	README.compile received a major enhancement

-	New files smake/job.c and smake/job.h in preparation of future
	parallel make enhancements

-	A new option -W gives extra warnings

-	An internal uname() implementation for a compilation on Win-DOS 
	was added

-	Smake -help now outputs help for -S

-	Smake now correctly implements the '+' command line prefix even
	when it has been called with -t (touch).

-	Smake now links against $(LIB_INTL)

-	A dynamic version of libschily now also links against $(LIB_INTL)

-	Better file PATH search allows smake to better find it's
	internal .../lib/defaults.smk file wthat contains the
	default rules (see libschily/searchinpath.c)

-	New function getexecpath() in libschily to implement a
	feature similar to getexecname() from SunOS.

-	New function get_progpath() in libschily allows to print command
	name via comerr*() even when save_args() was not called.
	

TODO:
	Smake would need to implement an undocumented feature from 
	historical UNIX make implementations that is used by Xorg
	at one place:

	target: *.o
		do-something-with *.o

	Which expands *.o from the filesystem. Meanwhile, use 
	smake -N to compile Xorg.

After pattern expansion has been implemented, smake-1.2 final
will be released.

P.P.S.: As Xorg changed it's build system, we may delay this
feature to something past 1.2-final.
	


WARNING: Do not use 'winzip' to extract the tar file!
	Winzip cannot extract symbolic links correctly.
